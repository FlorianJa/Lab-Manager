# Lab-Manager

The new Lab management software to implement pay-per-use concept for the Fab Lab Siegen

## Disclaimer

This project is prototype and still in development. There is no setup script or so. The code is just a snapshot to show how the concept could work.

## Project Status

![Lab Manager](https://github.com/FabLabSiegen/Lab-Manager/workflows/Lab%20Manager/badge.svg?branch=master)

## Key features

- Monitor and Assign available printer to visiting customers in the lab
- Access control via ESP8266 and RFID-reader by connecting/disconnecting OctoPrint to printer
- Store and retrieve print usage details
- Calculate, view and manage cost of each print
- Manage Maintenance of each printer by tracking print hours

# Setup

## ESP_RFID

Implementation for the ESP8266 that controls the RFID-Reader, interprets OctoPrint events and publishes MQTT commands to the broker

Path : ESP_RFID/ESP_RFID.ino

- Open the file ESP_RFID.ino in Arduino IDE (or) any preferred IDE
- Add required libraries ([ArduinoJson](https://arduinojson.org/?utm_source=meta&utm_medium=library.properties), [MFRC522](https://github.com/miguelbalboa/rfid), [PubSubClient](https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient)) to the IDE
- Search for the string "# WARNING", then Add Wi-Fi credentials and MQTT connection details
- Search for "# WARNING add RFID tag" and add RFID tag corresponding to the printer
- [Setup NodeMCU with RFID](https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FX4/GP96/J48Q18RQ/FX4GP96J48Q18RQ.png)
- Upload the code

## Lab-Manager (Django rest framework + Postgres-DB)

Back-End of the application is a REST api built using Django rest framework with Postgres-DB.

## Installation

- If you wish to run your own build, first ensure you have python globally installed in your computer. If not, you can get python [here](https://www.python.org").
- After doing this, confirm that you have installed virtualenv globally as well. If not, run this:
  ```bash
      $ pip install virtualenv
  ```
- Then, Git clone this repo to your PC

  ```bash
      $ git clone https://github.com/FabLabSiegen/Lab-Manager.git
  ```

- #### Dependencies

  1. Cd into your the cloned repo as such:
     ```
         $ cd Lab-Manager
     ```
  2. Create and fire up your virtual environment:
     ```bash
         $ virtualenv  venv -p python3
         $ source venv/bin/activate
     ```
  3. Dependencies such as [django-rest-framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs, [psycopg2](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/) (PostgreSQL database adapter for Python), [django-cors-headers](https://pypi.org/project/django-cors-headers/) (for allowing resources to be accessed on other domains), [simplejson](https://pypi.org/project/simplejson/) as json encoder/decoder are used to build the API.
     Install the dependencies needed to run the app:
     ```bash
         $ pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
  4. [Setup local Postgres-DB](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-postgresql-with-your-django-application-on-ubuntu-14-04)

     - Add credentials and db name in `settings.py`

  5. [paho-mqtt](https://pypi.org/project/paho-mqtt/) as MQTT client is used to connect to an MQTT broker to publish messages, and to subscribe to topics and receive published messages. In the file lab_manager\mqttservice.py, search for "WARNING add MQTT Host" and add MQTT host details

  6. Make those migrations work
     ```bash
         $ python manage.py makemigrations
         $ python manage.py migrate
     ```

- #### Run It
  Fire up the server using this one simple command:
  ```bash
      $ python manage.py runserver 8080
  ```
  You can now access the api endpoints on your browser.
- #### End points of REST API:

  - `GET, POST` printers detail available in Lab: ` api/printers`
  - `GET, PUT` each printer detail available in Lab: ` api/printers/{string:id}`
  - `GET, POST` user detail available in Lab: ` api/user`
  - `GET, PUT` each user detail available in Lab: ` api/user/{string:user}`
  - `GET, POST, DELETE` usage detail available in Lab: ` api/usage`
  - `GET, PUT, DELETE` each usage detail available in Lab: ` api/usage/{string:id}`
  - `GET` filament detail available in Lab: ` api/filament`
  - `GET, PUT` each filament detail available in Lab: ` api/filament/{string:filamentname}`
  - `GET, PUT` default material usage details: ` /api/material/{string:id}`
  - `GET, PUT` default printer usage details: ` /api/printer/{string:id}`
  - `GET, PUT` default operating usage details: ` /api/operating/{string:id}`

## Front-End (React App)

![Application view](https://github.com/FabLabSiegen/Lab-Manager/blob/newfeature/Uploads/Application_preview.gif)

Path : Lab-manager/Front-End

To get the Front-End application running locally:

- Install Node JS. Refer to https://nodejs.org/en/ to install nodejs.

- Install create-react-app npm package globally. This will help to easily run the project and also build the source files easily. Use the following command to install create-react-app

```bash
         $ npm install -g create-react-app
```

- Navigate to folder Lab-Manager/Front-End from command line

```
         $ cd Lab-Manager/Front-End
```

- Install all required dependencies. The Front-end is built using packages [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) as css framework, [React-Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) for state management, [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) as HTTP client,

```
         $ npm install
```

- Start the local server (this project uses [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html))

```
         $ npm start
```

Local web server will use port 8081 instead of standard React's port 3000 to prevent conflicts with some backends like Node. Port can be onfigured in scripts section of `package.json`. Once the Django API is running, Front-end starts interacting with the API.

## OctoPrint Setup for testing

OctoPrint is used to control and monitor every aspect of your 3D printer and your printing jobs right from within your browser.

- Setup OctoPrint based on your device, refer to https://octoprint.org/download/

- For installing OctoPrint on your local windows machine, refer to https://community.octoprint.org/t/setting-up-octoprint-on-windows/383.

- Once the OctoPrint is installed, create account and connect to Virtual Printer ([The Virtual Printer plugin](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/development/virtual_printer.html#enabling-the-virtual-printer) provides a virtual printer to connect to during development. The virtual printer has been included in OctoPrint by default. This plugin allows you to debug OctoPrintâ€™s serial communication without connecting to an actual printer. Furthermore, it is possible to create certain edge conditions that may be hard to reproduce with a real printer).

- Add [MQTT plugin](https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/mqtt/) and [MQTT Subscribe](https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/mqttsubscribe/) plugins to the OctoPrint to Pubilish/Subscribe messages from MQTT Broker. Refer procedure for adding plugins in OctoPrint https://plugins.octoprint.org/help/installation/

- Configure [MQTT plugin](https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/mqtt/) by entering MQTT connection details under Broker tab and configure topics using base topic: OctoPrint as [shown](https://github.com/FabLabSiegen/Lab-Manager/blob/newfeature/Uploads/MQTT_plugin_setup1.PNG)

- Configure [MQTT Subscribe](https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/mqttsubscribe/) plugin as [shown](https://github.com/FabLabSiegen/Lab-Manager/blob/newfeature/Uploads/MQTT_Subscribe_setup.png).
